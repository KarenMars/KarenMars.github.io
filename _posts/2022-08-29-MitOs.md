I feel that the knowledge of operating systems is of vital importance in my work. Although I have taken OS course during my study in TU Delft, I still feel that I should take a recap of it. 

### Materials
- [MIT course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2022/schedule.html)

### Lecture 1
- The purpose of operating systems
  - Abstract the hardware (for high level interfaces and abstractions for software to use)
  - Multiplexing (for multiple applications to share hardware, isolation i.e. bugs and security and share to allow cooperation)
- OS abstractions
  - process (a running program)
  - memory allocation
  - file descriptors
  - file names and directories
  - access control and quotas
  - Many others ......
- What are system calls
  - a interface between user and kernel
